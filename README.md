# Google-Search-Analysis

Although Google doesn't provide extensive access to data on daily search queries, another Google application can be utilized for analyzing Google searches. 
Google Trends has an API called "pytrends," which can be used to examine daily searches. 

You can install pytrends on your system easily by using the pip command, which is "pip install pytrends."

In this analysis, I have examined the Google search trends related to "Data Science Jobs" To accomplish this, I have created a DataFrame containing information on the top 10 countries that search for "Data Science Jobs" on Google. Further I have analysed the same search over the span of recent years and see the growth in Data Science Job searchs.
